## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

McMillan and Associates have hired our development team to design, develop, and implement an HRIS for their respected company. The information system will support the organization‚Äôs HR division, in support of the organization as a whole. This HRIS is the online solution to help McMillan an Associates to collect and store data on their employees. Included in this project is an applicant tracking system, payroll, benefits, time & attendance, training, performance, management, and employee self-service. This system will also allow for the management of all employee information.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

In order to get this web interface running, you‚Äôll need to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine.

### Installing

Installing the application is quite simple. In your terminal, navigate to the location by which you would like to house the repository. You can use the following command:

```
cd <directory>
```

Copy the repository URL by clicking "Code" and choosing the "HTTPS" method (you can configure this step as you wish). Use the following command in yout terminal to clone the repository.

```
git clone <repo-url>
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

You can test the system by first creating an account (Candidate) and adding a set of sample employees.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The web application should support most C.R.U.D functionalities as they pertain to a typical human resource information system. This includes (but is not limited to): creating, reading, updating and deleting organizational entities (departments, postions, benefits, accounts etc.), employee self-services (generation of timesheet with clock-in clock-out functionality), and an applicant tracking system.

## üöÄ Deployment <a id = "deployment"></a>

To get the application up and running, open the `backend` folder in any integrated development environment (for Java) of your choosing (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse). Next, cd into the `frontend` folder with your terminal using the following command:

```
cd <Woz-U-Final-Project/frontend>
```

Intall the react dependencies with the following command:
